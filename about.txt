Celestial Strands by by Saugia
This is a plug-in for Endless Sky that adds a new area of content based on the original Escape Velocity games, primarily Escape Velocity: Override.
Currently early in-progress - please back up your save first and visit https://github.com/Saugia/celestial-strands to report any bugs or issues.
To test the new content, you can either create a new pilot and select the Celestial Strands option, or visit the Horizo system that can be found near The Rim. Disclaimer: These methods are temporary.
