## About
Celestial Strands brings content from the original Escape Velocity series, primarily Escape Velocity: Override, to Endless Sky in a new playable area. The plug-in focuses on the various factions of the Crescent, including the Strands, Zachit, and Miranu, and their presence in a new, young galaxy. Will the Strands reunite once more under the same banner, or will inner turmoil be their undoing yet again?

Current additions:
* A new galactic area to explore containing a total of 110 new systems and 95 new planets.
* Seven new governments based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.
* 24 new ships and 50 ship variants based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.
* 41 new outfits based on ones from Escape Velocity: Override, as well as a few new ones.

## Content Access
You can access the new content either through creating a new pilot and selecting the "Crescent Strands" option, or through the Hariza system located near The Rim by Jump Drive. Recommend also using Omnis: https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/-Omnis

## Known Issues
Sometimes Militia or other fleets that have fighters with scanners clump up.

## Limitations
Currently, there is only the galaxy map, ships, outfits, and governments to play with. There is no story content as of yet.
Balancing is still in need of fine-tuning, however it has been done using EV:Override's data within Endless Sky's environment.
Planets do not have proper landscapes, descriptions, outfitter, or shipyard setups yet, and will be expanded upon in the future.
